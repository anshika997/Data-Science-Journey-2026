# NumPy Basics – Data Science Journey

## What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.  
It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, and a large collection of mathematical functions.

NumPy is widely used in Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and scientific applications.

## Why NumPy is Important?
- Faster than Python lists
- Efficient memory usage
- Supports large datasets
- Provides vectorized operations
- Base library for Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

---

## NumPy Array (ndarray)
The main object in NumPy is the ndarray.
- Stores homogeneous data (same data type)
- Can be 1D, 2D, or multi-dimensional
- Stored in continuous memory for fast access

Examples:
1D Array: [1, 2, 3]  
2D Array: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

## Key Concepts in NumPy
- Creating arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Shape, size, and data type
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting
- Vectorized computation
- Basic linear algebra operations
- Random number generation

## NumPy vs Python List

Feature            Python List        NumPy Array
Speed              Slow               Very Fast
Data Type          Mixed              Same type
Memory Usage       More               Less
Math Operations    Manual loops       Built-in functions

---

## Why NumPy is Faster?
- Written in C
- No type checking during execution
- Uses vectorized operations instead of loops
- Efficient memory management

---

## Use Cases of NumPy
- Data preprocessing
- Numerical computation
- Matrix operations
- Scientific research
- Machine learning input handling

## Learning Plan
Day 1: NumPy theory and basics  
Day 2 onward: Hands-on coding practice  
Daily progress will be committed to GitHub

---

## Goal
To build a strong foundation in NumPy for Data Science and Machine Learning applications.
