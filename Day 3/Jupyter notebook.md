## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a simple and interactive environment where we can write and execute code step by step.

### Key Features:
- Each notebook is saved as a `.ipynb` file
- Supports code, markdown, and raw text
- Ideal for quick prototyping and tutorials
- Uses **cells** to organize content

📌 *A cell is a container where we can write and run code or text.*

### How to Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
conda install jupyter
jupyter notebook
