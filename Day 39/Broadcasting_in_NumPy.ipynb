    "\n",
    "- Python’s interpreter: Every iteration of the loop requires Python to interpret the loop logic, which is inherently slower than lower-level, compiled code.\n",
    "- High overhead: Each loop iteration in Python involves additional overhead for function calls, memory access, and index management.\n",
