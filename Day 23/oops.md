# Day 04 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python 

This folder contains my learning notes and practice code for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python** as part of my **Data Science Journey 2026**.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Class and Object
- Creating classes using `class`
- Creating objects
- Using constructors (`__init__`)

### 2. Inheritance
- Reusing code using parent and child classes
- Using `super()` to access parent class methods

### 3. Encapsulation
- Protecting data using private variables
- Accessing data using methods

### 4. Polymorphism
- Same method name with different behavior
- Method overriding

##  Files Included

- `oops_basics.py` → Python code demonstrating OOP concepts with examples

---

##  Why OOPs is Important?
- Makes code reusable and organized
- Helps in building scalable applications
- Widely used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development

 *I am currently focusing on learning concepts clearly.  
Code practice will be expanded step-by-step as I progress.*

 **Learning → Practicing → Building Projects**
