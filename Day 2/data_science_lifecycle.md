# Data Science Lifecycle

The Data Science Lifecycle is a structured and iterative process that helps transform raw data into meaningful insights and actionable solutions.

---

## 1. Problem Definition
Understanding the problem you want to solve.

This step focuses on identifying business objectives and defining the key questions to answer.

### Example Questions:
- Can we predict customer churn?
- What factors drive sales?
- How can we find potential friends in a social network?

📌 *Example Project:*  
In the **“Coders of Delhi”** project, the goal is to find potential friends for a given person in a social network.

### Key Activities:
- Collaborate with stakeholders
- Define success metrics
- Set project goals and deliverables

---

## 2. Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from multiple sources.

Data may come from databases, APIs, web scraping, or third-party datasets. Sometimes data is provided directly by another team.

### Key Activities:
- Identify data sources (structured vs unstructured)
- Collect data using SQL, Python, or automated pipelines
- Ensure data relevance and completeness

---

## 3. Data Cleaning (Data Preprocessing)
Preparing raw data for analysis.

This step handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

### Key Activities:
- Handle missing or incorrect data
- Standardize formats
- Remove duplicates
- Manage outliers and inconsistencies

💡 **Fun Fact:**  
Data scientists spend nearly **80% of their time** cleaning data.

---

## 4. Data Exploration (EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis)
Analyzing patterns and relationships in data.

EDA helps understand data distributions and detect anomalies using statistics and visualizations.

### Key Activities:
- Summarize data (mean, median, etc.)
- Visualize patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Identify correlations and outliers

📌 *Example:*  
A 190 kg person in a dataset is an **outlier**.

---

## 5. Model Building
Creating and training machine learning models.

Models are used to predict outcomes or classify data.

### Key Activities:
- Choose suitable models (regression, decision trees, neural networks)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train and fine-tune models

### Common Tools:
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

---

## 6. Model Evaluation
Measuring model performance and accuracy.

Evaluation ensures the model is reliable and effective.

### Key Activities:
- Use performance metrics to measure correctness
- Perform cross-validation
- Compare multiple models

### Key Metrics:
- **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Regression:** RMSE, R-Squared

---

## 7. Deployment
Integrating the trained model into production systems.

### Key Activities:
- Package models using Flask or FastAPI
- Deploy models via APIs or dashboards
- Automate pipelines (MLOps)
- Monitor model performance

---

## 8. Communication & Reporting
Sharing insights with stakeholders.

Clear communication is critical so decision-makers can act on insights.

### Key Activities:
- Create dashboards
- Present findings clearly
- Document processes and results

---

## 9. Maintenance & Iteration
Keeping the model accurate and up-to-date.

### Key Activities:
- Monitor model performance
- Update models with new data
- Refine features and parameters

---

## Summary
The Data Science Lifecycle includes:

1. Problem Definition  
2. Data Collection  
3. Data Cleaning  
4. Data Exploration  
5. Model Building  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Deployment  
8. Communication & Reporting  
9. Maintenance & Iteration  

By following this lifecycle, data scientists convert raw data into meaningful insights that support better decision-making.
