# Loops in Python

## Introduction

In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.  
They help reduce code duplication and are essential for handling repetitive tasks such as processing data, iterating over lists, and performing calculations.

Python provides the following types of loops:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. nested loops
4. loop control statements (break, continue, pass)

## 1. for Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range.

### Syntax
```python
for variable in sequence:
    statement
