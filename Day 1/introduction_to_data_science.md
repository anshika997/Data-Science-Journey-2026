## Key Steps in Data Science

1. **Data Collection**  
   Gathering raw data from sources like websites, databases, sensors, and IoT devices.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Fixing errors, handling missing values, and removing inconsistencies.  
   *(This takes nearly 80% of a data scientist’s time.)*

3. **Data Analysis**  
   Using statistical methods to discover patterns and insights.

4. **Model Building**  
   Applying machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

5. **Interpretation & Communication**  
   Presenting results clearly to support decision-making.
