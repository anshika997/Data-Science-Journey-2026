# Python Strings – Complete Beginner Guide

## Introduction to Strings in Python

In Python, a **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in:
- Single quotes `' '`
- Double quotes `" "`
- Triple quotes `''' '''` or `""" """` (for multi-line strings)

Strings are **immutable**, which means once created, they **cannot be changed**.

## Creating Strings
